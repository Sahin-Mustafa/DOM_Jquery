            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br />
            Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is
            not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
            classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
            BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
            dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br />
            Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will
            be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
            uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
            evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
            (injected humour and the like). <br />
            Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem
            Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
            form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
            slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
            Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden
            in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
            Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this
            the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of
            over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
